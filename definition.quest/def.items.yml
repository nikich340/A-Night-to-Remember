      text: "Dear Geralt,<br><br>I sincerely hope this letter finds you and your beloved in good health.<br>As you may be aware, I find myself rather far away from Toussaint (too far, but surely there is no need to remind you of our shared circumstances leading me to this point in time), however my thoughts remain timelessly embedded within in its beautiful countryside.<br>I write you now in dire hope that it is not yet too late regarding the fate of a certain red-haired mutual acquaintance. If this is in fact true (and I dearly hope it is), I must ask a favor of you, my friend.<br>While I was unable to obtain the proper opportunity to tell you about her as much as I would have liked (and surely your experience at the orphanage has thwarted any hint of desire to learn the details of my familiarity with her), I reluctantly divulge that she does fact hold a memorable place for me, and as such, if there is any hint of possibility that she can be lead away from the monstrous path she has chosen, I beg you to find some way to assist her in doing so. I must remind you of my own unfortunate past, though I am rather ashamed to speak of such times.<br>It is my most sincere opinion that the act of drinking blood for sustenance is a mere myth. It is an act that stems from the most basic instincts that drive many a vampire to such behavior. However I am most certain Orianna possesses sufficient strength of character to remove herself from the confines of such primitive instincts.<br>And if you have exhausted all possibilities… Geralt, I implore you, please do take care. She possesses an immense amount of experience, and has already bested one witcher. I truly prefer you remain my living, breathing close friend for years to come.<br>I must mention again, if there is any possibility for a peaceful conclusion, please do take it. I have full faith that when the time comes (and in light of my humble request), you shall certainly make the best decision.<br><br>Sincerely, your faithful friend, R."

      text: "26th of June<br>It shouldn't surprise me that Detlaff proves yet again how he fails to grasp that humans can not be held to our standards. Unleashing his wrath on an entire city for the actions of one mere mortal reveals nothing more than weakness. What a disgrace to our kind.<br>Perhaps amidst all this burning and destruction, Regis and his witcher could be inspired to bring Detlaff to reason, at least temporarily. I suppose Arnaud and the children could benefit from my presence at the orphanage until things settle down. I shall go there.<br><br>27th of June<br>Death.. destruction.. blood everywhere.. my children… I can't describe it. This place wreaks of Garkain. Dettlaff has gone too far. My only comfort is that Niellan survived. He is with me now, and my presence calms him. A bit of his blood wouldn't hurt either.<br>Strange thing… Geralt of Rivia has joined me in my journey here. It seems I am of interest to him, again. He left quickly in search of the Unseen, so I am left wondering, what could he want with me? I see no reason why. I took excellent care of my children, fed them, gave them gifts. These actions are no different than any human. Regardless, he said he would return on day, but this annoys me less than the fact that Regis revealed our secret to him. I can only assume the circumstances must have been dire.<br>It appears Dettlaff has been stopped and the Vampires retreated. It is quiet once again. I am certain it was Regis' doing. It is astonishing how much my friend has changed. It appears the Humans have had a profound effect on him if he was willing to put his own life at risk for their sake. Such betrayal to our kind will have severe consequences. Perhaps he is the polar opposite to Dettlaff's childishness. The price we pay for living with Humans.<br>There is nothing left for us here. I must find a new house for the boy.<br><br>29th of June<br>I have found a modest house outside the city. It seems we will get along fine here. Though I have heard foolish rumors spreading about the orphanage. I must do whatever is necessary to quash them quickly. Though I can't stop thinking, is it possible the witcher revealed my nature to the duchess - I do doubt it, however it may be best to stay out of the city, at least for now. I do grow rather tired of the pompous life of secrecy and nobility.<br><br>14th of July<br>I was cleaning the bedroom today and found these notes, I must have written them several weeks ago.<br>With memories of that bloody night slowly fading and the city being restored, I grow to enjoy the quiet life here. Niellan likes this place too, especially the river nearby. Though since that dreadful Giant Centipede attack (where I thankfully killed most of them, but not without the consequence of a torn favorite dress) I decided that I will accompany him when he wishes to go there. There is no reason he should be in any danger while under my care.<br>I think I will find a tailor. I really did like that dress.<br><br>19th of July<br>Walking with Niellan by the river today, we came across a frightened girl in a boat. She was sitting beside her father's corpse. Niellan approached her with typically human empathic curiosity. According to Agneta's (her name) story her father's killers were either Drowners or perhaps a water hag. It was then that Niellan looked at me in such a pleading manner that I couldn't leave her there. Of course there is nothing wrong with a bit of blood variety, but.. his gaze… I am disturbed by the uncertain notion of whether or not more blood was my main motivation to agree. A strange thought.<br><br>23th of July<br>Today I wanted to taste a bit of Agneta's blood, and normally a child crying for her daddy doesn't bother me in the least. This time it was different. Could it be possible I felt… sympathy? Oh such nonsense. Perhaps Regis has gotten to me… or more likely that putrid concoction that wretched apothecary has been selling me for my headaches…<br>28th of July<br>Agneta has proven useful with cooking, as my cooking leaves much to be desired, but the children don't complain. I wanted to take Agneta to the market today, but Niellan refused to stay behind for chores. Apparently these two have become thick as thieves.<br>I don’t mind. I find their banter quite entertaining. Perhaps I shall forgot tonight's blood meal. I find it gratifying watching them play over the silent numbness that occurs after feeding.<br><br>1th of August<br>It turns out the feeling of blood changes after a long break. I began to drink from the Agneta and felt that the bloodlust was stronger than ever. It was as if a wild beast had awakened in me, demanding more and more, and I couldn't stop, even though I realised I shouldn't drink so much! By luck, Agneta survived. The medic said that if she will loose any more blood, she may die.<br>I always thought I could control my weakness, couldn't I? Did a primitive instinct get the better of me? I remember how blood drove Khagmar mad.. I'm disgusted with the idea that I will, like a savage, drink from everyone uncontrollably, draining already dead corporeal shells. Besides, I didn’t protect the children so that they would die at my hands. I seem to be embarrassed to look at the girl's suffering. What if she won't manage to recover?<br>So far, I've been drinking blood to survive. I learned to do it without killing and with having pleasure. But now it's more like a tasteless thirst quenching. I have to do it, but… Could there be another way?<br>While Agneta is recovering, and Niellan doesn't leave her for a minute, I will try to abstain from the blood for the moment, as an experiment.<br><br>3th of August<br>I was walking through the city to buy some fruits for Agneta, when suddenly some two cretins attacked me near my estate! I had to slit one's throat, and the other (named Baron Edward) ran away at once. Now he knows I'm not a human. Maybe I should have killed him too?<br>It's funny but this Baron called himself the boy's father. Even so, but where he was all these years? I took care of the Niellan after his mother's death, and he is only mine.<br>Fortunately, Agneta is better, she is on the mend and we've been already walking together to the river. While the children were splashing in the water, I watched them and felt the cool breeze and the warmth of the sun. This is very soothing and distracts from unsettling thoughts about hunger.<br>However, the longer I abstain, the less sure I am about self-controlling when it'll get really strong. I wonder what Regis would say to that…<br>"
