Dear friend!

I hope you are in good health with your beloved woman.
I am still away from Toussaint, but with my thoughts I am entirely in this beautiful land. I think you guess what haunts me - unfinished business with one red-haired woman.
During that terrible night in the Beauclair, I did not have time to tell you about her much. However, after what you saw that time in the orphanage, you are unlikely to be interested in the details of my familiarity with her. But I must ask you Geralt, as a friend with whom I have always been honest; If there is any hope that she has not become a bloodthirsty monster, I beg you to find a way to bring her down without grave harm. Remember, I was not ideal in past too, although I am ashamed to recall those times. Perhaps she will be able to get over this habit. In my opinion, this is a myth that blood is vital for a vampire, even the lowest, they simply are guided by instincts and do not try to resist their hunger. But I am sure that Orianna will have enough will and consciousness if she decides to follow my example.
And if not ... Geralt, get prepared. She has been living for many years and has a lot of experience.  Once she already fought with the witcher, and I think you understand what happened to him. This is another reason why I would like everything to be resolved peacefully.
And Iâ€™m sure that you of all people can make the right choice.

Sincerely, your faithful friend, R.
