      description:
        - regis_owl: After a bad nightmare, Geralt decided to go out and get some fresh air.<br>
        - regis_owl2: There was a surprise waiting for Geralt outside - a letter that was probably brought by an owl sitting nearby. Who could use the bird as a postman?<br>
        - regis_owl3: It turned out to be Regis. The vampire asked the witcher to find out about Orianna, and either help her overcome her monstrous weakness or.. take to extreme measures which Regis clearly trying to avoid out of fear for the lives of both his friends.<br>
        - orphanage1: During the search of Orianna, Geralt went to the orphanage - the last place where he has seen her. However, instead of Orianna, he met a trio of thugs there. The bandits told Geralt about their leader, Baron Edward, who was looking for Orianna and could tell Geralt news about her.<br>
        - orphanage_peaceful: Geralt was alarmed that the bandits were interested in the children from the orphanage, but he chose to mind his own business.<br>
        - orphanage_win: Geralt was alarmed that the bandits were interested in the children from the orphanage. Fists persuaded them to reveal the details, and Geralt learned that the Baron is looking for his son, who was sent to the orphanage by coincidence.<br>
        - orphanage_loose: Geralt was alarmed that the bandits were interested in the children from the orphanage. However, after trying to force the details out of them, Geralt failed and shamefully left the orphanage.<br>
        - camp: In the bandit camp, Geralt met Baron Edward, who told him about a recent meeting with Orianna, during which his friend Alfred was killed. The Baron told Geralt about his motives and hired the witcher to kill Orianna and bring the boy to him safely. But first he had to find Orianna, so he went to investigate the place where Alfred was killed.<br>
        - camp_amphitheatre: The witcher did as Baron asked and lifted the curse of the amphitheater.<br>
        - town_and_river: Geralt tracked Orianna to a river, where she paid a fisherman to take her to the Cockatrice Inn. Now Geralt was going there, sensing that he was very close.<br>
        - house: Geralt found a cozy house, where Orianna probably lived, but she was not at home that time. The witcher decided to take a moment to look around.<br>
        - house_diary: White Wolf found Orianna's diary, which told him about the events happened to her since their last meeting. Geralt realized that she take care of 2 kids (Nieallan and Agneta) and it was not so obvious what do with Orianna..<br>
        - orianna_killed: After a short conversation, Geralt did not deviate from the word given to the Baron and after the difficult battle managed to finish off the red-haired vampiress.<br>
        - baron_leave: Geralt told the baron where the children were, and made sure that he would not leave the girl alone. After receiving the promised reward, Geralt went on his way to Corvo Bianco.<br>
        - baron_killed_too: Geralt refused to tell the bandits where the children were. Furious Baron Edward challenged the witcher to a duel, that ended his story. Before his death, Edward ordered the bandits to leave Toussaint, and told Geralt to take his sword for the boy. Geralt took the orphaned children with him to Corvo Bianco, where they live to this day.<br>
        - orianna_spared: After a long conversation, Geralt was able to convince Orianna to find the strength to give up her addiction to children's blood. After that, he let her go, thinking it best to leave the children under her care. Maybe she'll end up being a good mom?<br>
        - baron_killed: The Baron was enraged by the witcher's decision, which led to bloodshed between them. Orianna, who, as it turned out, had been watching everything from afar, was surprised and even thanked Geralt for getting rid of the annoying "parent" of Nieallan.<br>
