      description:
        - camp_entry: "During the search for Orianna, Geralt met Baron Edward - the leader of a group of \"noble persons\", who however looked like common swashbucklers. Despite appearances, Baron Edward himself gave the impression of an honorable man plagued by tragic circumstance.<br><br>He came to Toussaint to reunite with his beloved, who unfortunately died. Now the Baron was determined to find his son, who was taken to Orianna's orphanage. Orianna was not eager to give the boy to the \"true father\", and even killed his subordinate Alfred. Baron Edward asked the witcher for help to bring revenge upon the red-haired devil.<br><br>"
        - ori_dead_bad_entry: "The Baron was initially pleased with Geralt slaying Orianna, but was enraged after Geralt declared him unfit to raise his own son Niellan. Baron Edward made a noble, albeit grave mistake challenging the witcher to a duel. Before his death, he demanded an end to the bloodshed for his son. In his final breath, he asked Geralt to take his sword as an heirloom for his son.<br><br>"
        - ori_dead_good_entry: "The Baron was pleased with Geralt slaying Orianna, and grateful when he learned that his son was unharmed. He was surprised to learn that Orianna had sheltered not only his son, but a girl too. He promised Geralt that he would not separate the children who'd become family to each other. Baron Edward gave the promised reward to the witcher and left Toussaint with the children.<br><br>"
        - ori_spared_entry: "The Baron was furious that the witcher let Orianna leave unharmed. The Baron and his men attacked with rage and Geralt was forced to paint the sand with their blood. This was the end of the story for Baron Edward and his band.<br><br>"
