      description:
        - camp_entry: "During the search for Orianna, Geralt met Baron Edward - the leader of a group of \"noble persons\", who, however, looked like common swashbucklers. Unlike them, the Baron himself gave the impression of not a simple bandit, but a deep personality with some mystery, perhaps even tragedy.<br><br>It turned out that he came to Toussaint in search of his beloved, who, unfortunately, died. Now he was determined to find his son, who was taken to the Orianna's orphanage, and it seems that caretaker herself is not eager to give the boy to the \"legal parent\", and even killed his friend Alfred. In this regard, Edward asked the witcher to solve the problem with Orianna.<br><br>"
        - ori_dead_bad_entry: "The baron was pleased with the Geralt's work (in the form of Orianna's motionless body), but when he learned that the witcher doesn't trust him and would prefer to raise the children himself, he was enraged and challenged Geralt to a duel. You can already guess that this act was a death mistake. However, before his death, he showed the nobility, dissuading the gang to avenge his defeat and asked the witcher to take his sword in order to pass it to the boy in the future.<br><br>"
        - ori_dead_good_entry: "The baron was pleased with the Geralt's work (in the form of Orianna's motionless body) and when he learned that the boy is not harmed and in the house nearby, he immediately gave the promised reward to the witcher. Edward was surprised that Orianna had sheltered not only his son, but a girl too, however he promised Geralt that he would not leave her alone. After that, the children, Baron Edward and his people left Toussaint.<br><br>"
        - ori_spared_entry: "The baron was furious that the witcher had just let Orianna go. Geralt immediately felt that the bandits needed to blow off some steam and it won't be just a conversation... This was the end of the story of Baron Edward and his band.<br><br>"
