2114670774|00000000||But she doesn't want to come here. So there's something wrong with here. We are few, and we guard the places where she used to be.
2114670783|00000000||Perhaps you could help us, and then our leader Baron Edward will give you a decent reward.

2114670801|00000000||Baron won't be happy… Alright, I'll tell you what I know.
2114670802|00000000||Years ago our leader, Baron Edward, visited Toussaint, where he met a beautiful lass.
2114670803|00000000||And a wee boy was born to them.
2114670804|00000000||The Baron went with us to the far lands, where we were culled by battalions of Nilfs.
2114670805|00000000||Well, I can't say that the Baron liked that girl much, as he left her here. However he recently said we must visit Toussaint again.
2114670806|00000000||We came here and found out that she had died of some illness about a year ago. And the boy was sent to an orphanage, to this Orianna.
2114670807|00000000||But we didn't manage to find neither the boy nor Orianna.
2114670808|00000000||Since that vampire attack the orphanage has been abandoned… All that remains now is a mess and a pile children's corpses.
2114670809|00000000||The Baron was quite upset. But then we learned that Orianna is alive and in perfect health - people saw her in the city with the wee boy.
2114670810|00000000||The Baron is certain that this is his son, and very much wants to find this woman. However she is… elusive, everyone knows her, but where she is - no one seems to know.
2114670811|00000000||So we divided into groups and now watching for places where she may appear.
2114670812|00000000||To be honest, I'm well tired of sittin' around here waitin'… So if you could find a way to help us, it'd be well appreciated!
2114670813|00000000||I see it now. It's a deal.

;;;0001105762|00000000||No. Haven't loved. Now let's get to the point.
;
2114670400|00000000||I loved a woman once….
2114670401|00000000||I was born a commoner, but I was gifted with a blade.
2114670411|00000000||After proving myself in battle, the Duke of Toussaint knighted me as a young man.
2114670412|00000000||It was quite a spectacle, all the nobles wanted to meet the low-born Knight.
2114670413|00000000||That's how I met her, the only one who didn't care about all that.
2114670414|00000000||We fell in love… We had a son together, and we were happy, for a time.
2114670415|00000000||When word broke that she bore a child to a commoner, outside of wedlock…
2114670416|00000000||I fled Beauclair that very night, and I made her promise to say the child was against her will.
2114670417|00000000||She broke our promise. Her family quickly fell out of favor. They lost everything because of me.
2114670418|00000000||A few months ago, I received word that she had fallen ill, and our child had been orphaned…
2114670419|00000000||I never should have left her alone in that city.
2114670420|00000000||After all of these years of regret… I need to do right by her and take care of our son.
2114670421|00000000||What do you say witcher? Will you take the job, and return my boy?
;

;
;   1209328|00000000||Need to talk about my fee, first.
2114670898|00000000||I couldn't pay so much even if  you were King Radovid!
2114670899|00000000||That's a bit high, witcher.
2114670900|00000000||Thank you, witcher. I will repay you.
2114670901|00000000||My patience has ended! You will take my offer - 3000 orens, or get out of here!
2114670902|00000000||Have you changed your mind, witcher?
;   1007115|00000000||All right.
;   1030870|00000000||Hmm… Need to think about it.
2114670904|00000000||You fight for a noble cause. But if you return my boy… I will find a way to repay you.
2114670905|00000000||But I need more information. Your friend… What happened to him?
2114670906|00000000||We set up an ambush, outside Orianna's estate.
2114670907|00000000||Alfred and I had her cornered, with nowhere to go. I asked her what she'd done with my son.
2114670903|00000000||She gave a contemptible answer, so Alfred motioned for his blade.
2114670908|00000000||All at once she vanished. And Alfred… I was covered in his blood. There was nothing I could do!
2114670909|00000000||What kind of creature could do such a thing?
2114670910|00000000||Uh, must be a kind of vampire.
2114670911|00000000||A vampire? Geralt, my son is in danger. You're my only hope!
2114670912|00000000||All right, see if I can find her.
2114670913|00000000||You're not wrong. We've heard some strange sounds… In that direction, by the amphitheater.
2114670914|00000000||I told my men to stay away from it. It'd be nice, if you could have a look.

2114670946|00000000||Things like me?
2114670947|00000000||It's time.
2114670948|00000000||Well, no witcher's ever died in his own bed.
2114670949|00000000||You won't be an exception.
;
;   1172302|00000000||We don't have to fight.
2114670968|00000000||You've killed a man who wanted to reunite a boy with his father.
2114670950|00000000||Well, the threat of a sword doesn't always bring out the best in me.
2114670951|00000000||Fair enough. But the children… You can't continue to use them as livestock.
2114670952|00000000||And who exactly are you to lecture me?
2114670953|00000000||I know this might sound strange but I want to help you. I've come across something interesting in your house…
2114670954|00000000||So, you've been snooping around… Do I intrigue you that much, witcher?
2114670955|00000000||Orianna, your orphanage was destroyed. You've tried to rebuild it, but you're about to lose it all again.
;2114670451|00000000||I think somewhere deep inside, you don't want to be the same monster anymore.
2114670451|00000000||I get the feeling you no longer consider these repetitive circumstances as minor inconveniences.
2114670956|00000000||So you've read a few meaningless musings and now you presume to understand me?
2114670957|00000000||I may not understand you, but I do know one thing. You don't have to drink blood.
2114670958|00000000||Haha, such nonsense, witcher. Need I remind you of what I am? Drinking blood is essential to my survival.
2114670969|00000000||You can't help me. No one can help me.
2114670976|00000000||Know what? You're right.
2114670450|00000000||Don't feel like talking to you anymore.
2114670452|00000000||Goodbye, witcher…
;
;   1007115|00000000||All right.
2114670979|00000000||I may not be able to, but a mutual friend may be able to.
2114670959|00000000||Look at this.
2114670960|00000000||Hmm. Regis, Regis… Awfully considerate as always.
2114670977|00000000||"The act of drinking blood for sustenance is a mere myth", interesting… He seems certain…
2114670967|00000000||Well, I suppose he'd be upset if we tussled, wouldn't he?
2114670971|00000000||Even if you kill me… Villagers, knights and other witchers will always come after you, and you know it.
2114670978|00000000||You've no idea what it's like to constantly fight to overcome your hunger, your nature. However..
2114670972|00000000||Give me a moment.
2114670453|00000000||One who comes from Gharasham must be strong in spirit, merciful and noble. Really, Regis? When we first met you took so much pride in attacking these feeble humans from above.
2114670454|00000000||And now it seems things have changed… apparently. Perhaps after all these centuries… it is finally time.
2114670455|00000000||All right, Regis.
2114670961|00000000||I've made my decision.
2114670457|00000000||I vow never to feed on blood again.
;;; (-) 2114670962|00000000||But Niellan and Agneta will stay with me. I'm used to take care of them and… It will distract me from obsessive thoughts about hunger.
2114670963|00000000||Can I trust you to keep your vow?
2114670964|00000000||Unlike your kind, witcher, we tend to keep our promises.
;   1027471|00000000||Hmm… Guess I believe you…
2114670973|00000000||Alright. But you must leave Toussaint immediately. The guards are looking for you.
2114670974|00000000||I suppose it was inevitable.. I shall leave this place.
2114670965|00000000||Where will you go?
2114670456|00000000||The letter you gave me wasn't only meant for you, Geralt.
2114670975|00000000||I see. Well, good luck then.
2114670966|00000000||I shall take my valuables and say goodbye to the children. Wait for me here, White Wolf.

2114670324|00000000||Now tell me, where's my boy?

2114670337|00000000||All right, I will.
2114670338|00000000||Sure hope so. Here's my advice, don't show it to them.
2114670339|00000000||I wish Neillan could have known his real mother… It seems this is where our paths diverge, Geralt.
