2114670651|||A letter… Who's using an owl for this?
2114670652|00000000||Regis… Just trying to avoid a fight, to protect her.
2114670653|00000000||Well, I should check an orphanage in a swamp. Last time Orianna was there.
2114670654|00000000||Go home. I'm a witcher. Need to examine the body.
2114670655|00000000||Woman turned back here.
2114670656|00000000||Think she was looking for Regis. But he left.
2114670657|00000000||Fishermen should know something.
2114670658|00000000||Tracks lead to this house.
2114670659|00000000||House looks inhabited… No sign of the dweller, though. Guess I'll look around.
2114670660|00000000||Interesting… Regis might be right.
2114670661|00000000||I'll wait her outside.

2114670700|||Triss?! I should talk to her.
2114670705|||I've been thinking about us.
2114670706|||I'm looking for…
2114670707|||I'm not Yennefer, Geralt. But I can be like Yennefer!
2114670708|||So, what do you think?
2114670709|||You don't like me..
2114670710|||You realize - one word and you'll howl with pain!
2114670711|||I'm your nightmare!
2114670727|||Geralt, please…
2114670728|||Show me your face.
2114670729|||I must be out of my mind… Vesemir!
2114670730|||I warned you. Pissing upwind leads to disaster.
2114670731|||This time you pissed in a tornado.
2114670732|||Do anything stupid and they'll tie you down on an anthill, face coated with honey. You'll scream so loud even the storm riders will hear you.
2114670733|||Are you ghosts?
2114670734|||I'm sorry, my friend…
2114670735|||You wish to give your soul for this?
2114670736|||Then you don't have what I need.
2114670737|||Is it your doing?
2114670738|||So you say, yet I wait and wait, and nothing…
2114670739|||Fuck you!
2114670740|||Death mistake.
2114670745|||Crazy nightmare.

2114670768|00000000||I suppose to find a red-haired woman here.
2114670769|00000000||That's interesting. Because we're supposed to meet her too.
2114670770|00000000||Why are you looking for her?
2114670771|00000000||Our boss has questions for 'er about the orphanage and children.
2114670772|00000000||The orphanage was attacked and almost none of the children survived.
2114670773|00000000||Almost - nice word, so someone is alive. And we know for sure that Orianna herself is alive too.
2114670774|00000000||But she doesn't want to come here. So there's something wrong with here. We are few, and we guard the places where she used to be.
2114670783|00000000||Perhaps you could help us, and then our leader Baron Edward will give you a decent reward.
2114670775|00000000||Why are you interested in children?
2114670776|00000000||It's no concern of yours.
2114670777|00000000||Orianna will kill you. She is a monster, not a human. And only I can help. Meaning I need more information.

2114670800|00000000||Gonna answer me?
2114670801|00000000||Baron won't be happy… Alright, I'll tell you what I know.
2114670802|00000000||Years ago our leader, Baron Edward, visited Toussaint, where he met a beautiful lass.
2114670803|00000000||And a wee boy was born to them.
2114670804|00000000||The Baron went with us to the far lands, where we were culled by battalions of Nilfs.
2114670805|00000000||Well, I can't say that the Baron liked that girl much, as he left her here. However he recently said we must visit Toussaint again.
2114670806|00000000||We came here and found out that she had died of some illness about a year ago. And the boy was sent to an orphanage, to this Orianna.
2114670807|00000000||But we didn't manage to find neither the boy nor Orianna.
2114670808|00000000||Since that vampire attack the orphanage has been abandoned… All that remains now is a mess and a pile children's corpses.
2114670809|00000000||The Baron was quite upset. But then we learned that Orianna is alive and in perfect health - people saw her in the city with the wee boy.
2114670810|00000000||The Baron is certain that this is his son, and very much wants to find this woman. However she is… elusive, everyone knows her, but where she is - noone seems to know.
2114670811|00000000||So we divided into groups and now watching for places where she may appear.
2114670812|00000000||To be honest, I'm well tired of sittin' around here waitin'… So if you could find a way to help us, it'd be well appreciated!
2114670813|00000000||I see it now. It's a deal.
2114670814|00000000||Then you should talk to the Baron.

2114670881|00000000||Greetings, Baron! Any news? Where is Alfred?
2114670882|00000000||He is dead. Orianna killed him.
2114670883|00000000||What?! How? Did you find her?
2114670884|00000000||She is not just a woman… Maybe witch or monster. I can't understand what happened myself.
2114670885|00000000||And who are.. Witcher! It must be destiny sent you to us.
2114670886|00000000||Actually it was your friends. My name is Geralt.
2114670887|00000000||The famous Geralt of Rivia?
2114670888|00000000||Great. My name is Edward and I am the leader of…
;   1075517|00000000||Bandits?
;2114670889|00000000||Don't be so conservative. We do not rob and kill peaceful merchants.
2114670890|00000000||I don't believe it. However I'm here about Orianna.
2114670891|00000000||Yeah. This whore refused to return my son and killed Alfred.
2114670892|00000000||As she is some kind of monster and you are witcher… Could you find and exterminate her? For a fee of course.
2114670893|00000000||Why do you wanna take the child?
2114670894|00000000||I believe that he is my son and I want to raise him.

2114670897|00000000||And I'm asking for your aid not as bandit, but as father of the boy in distress…
;   1209328|00000000||Need to talk about my fee, first.
2114670898|00000000||I wouldn't pay so much even if you were King Radovid.
2114670899|00000000||That's just a bit high, witcher.
2114670900|00000000||Fine.

;2114670902|00000000||Changed your mind, witcher?
;   1007115|00000000||All right.
;   1030870|00000000||Hmm… Need to think about it.
2114670903|00000000||Not interested in coins. Will make it for free.
2114670904|00000000||The noble witcher? Just wondering…
2114670905|00000000||I need more information. What happened to Alfred?
2114670906|00000000||We were guarding Orianna's house while finally met her.
2114670907|00000000||I called her and asked where is the boy. She refused to answer. Alfred began to threaten her and drew his sword.
2114670908|00000000||After this she moved at once and vanished. And Alfred… His throat was slit. I could not help him…
2114670909|00000000||How? What creature can do such things?
2114670910|00000000||Must be a bruxa, a kind of vampire.

2114670925|00000000||The woman came from that direction by the cemetery.
2114670926|00000000||Paid me a tidy sum to take her across the river.
2114670927|00000000||She was nervous and dirty, but I didn't ask her about it.
2114670928|00000000||I dropped her off near the Cockatrice Inn.

2114670956|00000000||That I started to change? It's just my guessings.

2114670343|00000000||I challenge you to a duel. You and I.

2114670355|00000000||No…

2114670356|00000000||Good choice.

;   1101069|00000000||Greetings.
2114670360|00000000||What the hell, witcher? Why did you let Orianna leave? Turned yellow?
;   1174787|00000000||Despite what you might've heard, I don't lunge at every monster I see, sword in hand. Talking gets the job done for some.
2114670361|00000000||Bullshit. You were to kill her, not help her.
;   1181655|00000000||Mhm. But I changed my mind.
2114670362|00000000||I don't have to explain myself to you.
2114670363|00000000||I think you're just coward and traitor.
2114670364|00000000||Wanna know what happen to everyone who betrayed my trust?
;    490004|00000000||That a threat?
2114670365|00000000||Kill him!

2114670375|00000000||A slayer of monsters slayed people to protect monster. You managed to impress me.
;    458827|00000000||It was the lesser evil… I think.
2114670376|00000000||Probably this annoying Baron promised you a huge reward for me, right?
2114670377|00000000||You can pick up his sword instead of this. I know, you like these sharp things.
;   1066805|00000000||Mhm. Thanks a bunch.
2114670378|00000000||Good luck, Geralt of Rivia.
2114670379|00000000||So long, Orianna.
