2114670651|||A letter... Who's using an owl for this?
2114670652|00000000||Regis... Just trying to avoid a fight, to protect her.
2114670653|00000000||Well, I should check an orphanage in a swamp. Last time Orianna was there.
2114670654|00000000||Go home. I'm a witcher. Need to examine the body.
2114670655|00000000||Woman turned back here.
2114670656|00000000||Think she was looking for Regis. But he left.
2114670657|00000000||Fishermen should know something.
2114670658|00000000||Tracks lead to this house.
2114670659|00000000||House looks inhabited… No sign of the dweller, though. Guess I'll look around.
2114670660|00000000||Interesting… Regis might be right.
2114670661|00000000||I'll wait her outside.
;
2114670700|||Triss?! I should talk to her.
2114670705|||I've been thinking about us.
2114670706|||I'm looking for...
2114670707|||I'm not Yennefer, Geralt. But I can be like Yennefer!
2114670708|||So, what do you think?
2114670709|||You don't like me..
2114670710|||You realize - one word and you'll howl with pain!
2114670711|||I'm your nightmare!
2114670727|||Geralt, please...
2114670728|||Show me your face.
2114670729|||I must be out of my mind... Vesemir!
2114670730|||I warned you. Pissing upwind leads to disaster.
2114670731|||This time you pissed in a tornado.
2114670732|||Do anything stupid and they'll tie you down on an anthill, face coated with honey. You'll scream so loud even the storm riders will hear you.
2114670733|||Are you ghosts?
2114670734|||I'm sorry, my friend...
2114670735|||You wish to give your soul for this?
2114670736|||Then you don't have what I need.
2114670737|||Is it your doing?
2114670738|||So you say, yet I wait and wait, and nothing...
2114670739|||Fuck you!
2114670740|||Death mistake.
2114670745|||Crazy nightmare.

2114670767|00000000||Well, get in here, will talk with you.
2114670768|00000000||I suppose to find a red-haired woman here.
2114670769|00000000||That's interesting. Because we supposed to meet her too.
2114670770|00000000||Why are you looking for her?
2114670771|00000000||Our boss has questions for her about orphanage and children.
2114670772|00000000||The orphanage was attacked and almost none of the children survived.
2114670773|00000000||Almost - nice word. So someone is alive. And we know for sure that Orianna herself is alive too.
2114670774|00000000||But she doesn't want to come here. So there's something wrong here. We are few, and we guard the places where she used to be. Perhaps you could help us, and then our leader Baron Edward will give you a decent reward.
2114670775|00000000||Why are you interested in children?
2114670776|00000000||It's no concern of yours.
2114670777|00000000||Orianna will kill you. She is a monster, not a human. And only I can help. Meaning I need more information.
2114670778|00000000||Do you think we believe first fella? Talk with our leader about it.
;   1117735|00000000||I'll ask again, polite like, and you'll answer, just as politely.

2114670780|00000000||Three against one - you're dead already.
2114670781|00000000||It's a deal. Where can I find him?
2114670782|00000000||We have pitched camp on the banks of the lake known as Seidhe Llygad, near an ancient amphitheater.

2114670800|00000000||Gonna answer me?
2114670801|00000000||Baron won't be happy... Alright, I'll tell you what I know.
2114670802|00000000||A few years ago our leader, Baron Edward, visited Toussaint, where he met a beautiful girl.
2114670803|00000000||A boy was born to them.
2114670804|00000000||The Baron went with us to the far lands, where we were culled by battalions of Nilfs.
2114670805|00000000||Well, I can't say that the Baron liked that girl much, as he left her here. However recently he said we must visit Toussaint again.
2114670806|00000000||We came here and found out that she had died of some illness about a year ago. And the boy was sent in an orphanage, to this Orianna.
2114670807|00000000||But we didn't manage to find neither boy nor Orianna.
2114670808|00000000||After that vampire attack the orphanage is abandoned, only a mess and a pile of children's old corpses.
2114670809|00000000||Baron was quite upset. But then we learned that Orianna is alive and in perfect health, people saw her in the city with the boy.
2114670810|00000000||Baron is sure that this is his son and very much wants to find this woman. However she is... elusive, everyone know her but where she is - no idea.
2114670811|00000000||So we divided into groups and now watching for places where she may appear.
2114670812|00000000||To be honest, I'm tired of sitting on one place, so if you could help us, it would be great.
2114670813|00000000||I see it now. It's a deal.
2114670814|00000000||Then you should talk with our leader.

2114670918|00000000||I catch more when it's raining.
2114670919|00000000||Did you see a red-haired woman here? Left this site by boat, recently.
2114670920|00000000||Maybe. Maybe not. Give me a few coins and I'll try to remember.
;    400593|00000000||I want to help that woman. She could be in danger.

;   1125802|00000000||Asking a lot. Too much. How about you do this free of charge, huh? Out of the kindness of your heart?

;    434805|00000000||Fine… I'll pay.
2114670923|00000000||Oh, I'm lucky to stumble across wealth today.
2114670924|00000000||Well… you listen up.
2114670925|00000000||The woman came from that direction by the cemetery.
2114670926|00000000||Paid me a tidy sum to take her across the river.
2114670927|00000000||She was nervous and dirty, but I didn't ask her about it.
2114670928|00000000||I dropped her off near the Cockatrice Inn.
2114670929|00000000||She hopped off the boat without saying a word…

2114670952|00000000||You know, I am the vampiress. And I can't resist the blood hunger.
2114670953|00000000||Think you can handle this on your own. Found something interesting in your house.
2114670954|00000000||So, you snuck in my house and decided to show off with it? You call those manners?
2114670955|00000000||Orianna, that doesn't change the fact that...
2114670956|00000000||That I started to change? It's just my guessings.
2114670957|00000000||Don't deny it.
2114670958|00000000||That's not enough to convince me.
;   1007115|00000000||All right.
2114670959|00000000||Take a look at this.
2114670960|00000000||Hmm. Regis, Regis… Awfully noble as always.
;   1101409|00000000||Well, I probably wouldn't 'ave forced myself on you.
2114670961|00000000||Fine. I've come to a decision - I vow not to hurt kids anymore.
2114670962|00000000||But they will stay with me. I'll take care of them. And it's not up for discussion.
2114670963|00000000||If you break your vow I'll come back, and someone'll get hurt.
2114670964|00000000||I'd sooner drink from vagrant than break my word.
