2114670801|00000000||Baron won't be happy… Alright, I'll tell you what I know.
2114670802|00000000||Years ago our leader, Baron Edward, visited Toussaint, where he met a beautiful lass.
2114670803|00000000||And a wee boy was born to them.
2114670804|00000000||The Baron went with us to the far lands, where we were culled by battalions of Nilfs.
2114670805|00000000||Well, I can't say that the Baron liked that girl much, as he left her here. However he recently said we must visit Toussaint again.
2114670806|00000000||We came here and found out that she had died of some illness about a year ago. And the boy was sent to an orphanage, to this Orianna.
2114670807|00000000||But we didn't manage to find neither the boy nor Orianna.
2114670808|00000000||Since that vampire attack the orphanage has been abandoned… All that remains now is a mess and a pile children's corpses.
2114670809|00000000||The Baron was quite upset. But then we learned that Orianna is alive and in perfect health - people saw her in the city with the wee boy.
2114670810|00000000||The Baron is certain that this is his son, and very much wants to find this woman. However she is… elusive, everyone knows her, but where she is - no one seems to know.
2114670811|00000000||So we divided into groups and now watching for places where she may appear.
2114670812|00000000||To be honest, I'm well tired of sittin' around here waitin'… So if you could find a way to help us, it'd be well appreciated!
2114670813|00000000||I see it now. It's a deal.

;
2114670400|00000000||I loved a woman once….
2114670401|00000000||I was born a commoner, but I was gifted with a blade.
2114670411|00000000||After proving myself in battle, the Duke of Toussaint knighted me as a young man.
2114670412|00000000||It was quite a spectacle, all the nobles wanted to meet the low-born Knight.
2114670413|00000000||That's how I met her, the only one who didn't care about all that.
2114670414|00000000||We fell in love… We had a son together, and we were happy, for a time.
2114670415|00000000||When word broke that she bore a child to a commoner, outside of wedlock…
2114670416|00000000||I fled Beauclair that very night, and I made her promise to say the child was against her will.
2114670417|00000000||She broke our promise. Her family quickly fell out of favor. They lost everything because of me.
2114670418|00000000||A few months ago, I received word that she had fallen ill, and our child had been orphaned…
2114670419|00000000||I never should have left her alone in that city.
2114670420|00000000||After all of these years of regret… I need to do right by her and take care of our son.
2114670421|00000000||What do you say witcher? Will you take the job, and return my boy?
;
2114670895|00000000||I don't work for bandits.

2114670897|00000000||I'm asking for your help as a father... And I can reward you handsomely.
;
;   1209328|00000000||Need to talk about my fee, first.
2114670898|00000000||I couldn't pay so much even if  you were King Radovid!
2114670899|00000000||That's a bit high, witcher.
2114670900|00000000||Thank you, witcher. I will repay you.
2114670901|00000000||My patience has ended! You will take my offer - 3000 orens, or get out of here!
2114670902|00000000||Have you changed your mind, witcher?
;   1007115|00000000||All right.
;   1030870|00000000||Hmm… Need to think about it.
2114670904|00000000||You fight for a noble cause. But if you return my boy... I will find a way to repay you.
2114670905|00000000||But I need more information. Your friend… What happened to him?
2114670906|00000000||We set up an ambush, outside Orianna's estate.
2114670907|00000000||Alfred and I had her cornered, with nowhere to go. I asked her what she'd done with my son.
2114670903|00000000||She gave a contemptible answer, so Alfred motioned for his blade.
2114670908|00000000||All at once she vanished. And Alfred... I was covered in his blood. There was nothing I could do!
2114670909|00000000||What kind of creature could do such a thing?
2114670910|00000000||Uh, must be a kind of vampire.
2114670911|00000000||A vampire? Geralt, my son is in danger. You're my only hope!
2114670912|00000000||All right, see if I can find her.
2114670913|00000000||You're not wrong. We've heard some strange sounds... In that direction, by the amphitheater.
2114670914|00000000||I told my men to stay away from it. It'd be nice, if you could have a look.

2114670944|00000000||Folk have forgotten it.
2114670945|00000000||Got… other things on their mind.
2114670946|00000000||Things like me?
2114670976|00000000||Know what…? Don't feel like talking to you anymore.
2114670947|00000000||It's time.
2114670948|00000000||Well, no witcher's ever dead in his own bed.
2114670949|00000000||You won't be an exception.
;   1172302|00000000||We don't have to fight.
2114670968|00000000||You've killed an innocent man who wanted to reunite the Baron with his son.
2114670950|00000000||Well, the threat of a sword doesn't always bring out the best in me.
2114670951|00000000||Alright, but what about the children... You are using them as a livestock!
2114670952|00000000||You know what I am. I can't resist the hunger.
2114670953|00000000||No, you can. I have read something interesting in your house…
2114670954|00000000||Ha! So, you've been snooping around... Do I intrigue you that much, witcher?
2114670955|00000000||Orianna, I know you don't want to be the same… person more.
2114670956|00000000||You presume to understand me? After reading some my... musings?
2114670957|00000000||I helped some creatures before. And I want to help you too.
2114670958|00000000||Geralt, I'm vampires. If I give up drinking blood, I will die...
2114670969|00000000||You can't help me. Nobody can help me.
;   1007115|00000000||All right.
2114670979|00000000||Think mutual friend of us could.
2114670959|00000000||Take a look at this.
2114670960|00000000||Hmm. Regis, Regis… Awfully considerate as always.
2114670977|00000000||"Remove herself from the confines of such primitive instincts", interesting… He is sure that every of us is able to live without blood.
2114670967|00000000||I suppose he'd be upset if we tussled, wouldn't he?
;;;2114670971|00000000||I kill monsters, true - it's my job. But only when they threaten humans.
;;;2114670978|00000000||If you change your attitude towards the children and refuse drinking the blood, I will spare your life.
2114670971|00000000||You're not my friend, true. But not the enemy anymore. 
2114670978|00000000||It remains to do the last step - give up with blood-drinking. Like Regis did. And we'll part in peace.
;   1101409|00000000||Well, I probably wouldn't 'ave forced myself on you.
2114670972|00000000||Nice suggestion. But I have a lot to think about. Alone.
2114670961|00000000||Very well then, I've made my decision - I won't feed on the children's blood again.
2114670962|00000000||But Niellan and Agneta will stay with me. I'm used to take care of them and... It will distract me from obsessive thoughts about hunger.
2114670963|00000000||Leave children with you? What if you will break your vow?
2114670964|00000000||Unlike your kind, we tend to keep our promises.
;   1027471|00000000||Hmm… Guess I believe you…
2114670973|00000000||Alright, I'll trust you, against my better judgment.
2114670974|00000000||But one day I'll visit children, and if I see any small scratch on them…
2114670965|00000000||As you wish, Geralt. Not a hair on their heads shall come to any harm, I vow.
2114670975|00000000||Sure hope so. You can go then.
2114670966|00000000||See you, White Wolf.

2114670321|00000000||Hey, witcher!
2114670322|00000000||You're alive?
2114670323|00000000||Glad to hear it. Finally this dirty whore got what she's deserved.
2114670324|00000000||Now say where is my son.
2114670325|00000000||I don't know where he is.
2114670326|00000000||Wrong answer. You think nobody saw you having interesting conversation with Orianna?
2114670327|00000000||I give you one more try.
;   1068309|00000000||Your son is dead.
2114670328|00000000||Where is his body?
2114670329|00000000||Hmmm…er…well…
2114670330|00000000||You seek to trick me, witcher.
2114670331|00000000||Perhaps I have to loosen your tongue with a knife.
2114670332|00000000||I'll take care of him myself.
2114670333|00000000||Are you mad, you twit?
2114670334|00000000||You're common bandits. I don't trust you.
2114670335|00000000||You'll regret that you got in my way.
2114670336|00000000||The children are in that house. A young girl with a boy. Alive.
;   1091952|00000000||You'll look after her?
2114670337|00000000||All right, I will.
2114670338|00000000||Sure hope so. Here's my advice, don't show it to them.
2114670339|00000000||True. In this case here our paths diverge.
2114670340|00000000||There's your payment. And good luck.
;   1019171|00000000||Farewell.
2114670341|00000000||You refused the money. But I have another reward for you.
;   1130945|00000000||What a surprise.
2114670342|00000000||My favourite sword. Was made to order by an elven swordsmith.
;    451753|00000000||Thank you. Farewell.

2114670356|00000000||Good choice.
2114670357|00000000||No! Destiny showed me that I am not worthy of raising the boy… Leave us alone.
2114670358|00000000||I'm gonna fucking kill you, witcher!
2114670359|00000000||Geralt… Take my sword… For the boy…

;   1101069|00000000||Greetings.
2114670360|00000000||What the hell, witcher? Why did you let Orianna leave? Turned yellow?
;   1174787|00000000||Despite what you might've heard, I don't lunge at every monster I see, sword in hand. Talking gets the job done for some.
2114670361|00000000||Bullshit. You were to kill her, not help her.
;   1181655|00000000||Mhm. But I changed my mind.
2114670362|00000000||I don't have to explain myself to you.
2114670363|00000000||I think you're just coward and traitor.
2114670364|00000000||Wanna know what happen to everyone who betrayed my trust?
;    490004|00000000||That a threat?
2114670365|00000000||Kill him!

2114670375|00000000||A witcher has slain a man to protect a monster. I'll admit, I'm impressed.
;    458827|00000000||It was the lesser evil… I think.
2114670376|00000000||I'm sure this… troublesome Baron Edward promised a sizable reward, right?
2114670377|00000000||Here.
;   1066805|00000000||Mhm. Thanks a bunch.
